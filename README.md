Hi! My name is Bethany and I am a student interested in web development & design.

This project primarily uses for my learning purpose, which I used Python & Flask to create a simple personal portfolio with the CSS and HTML styling.

I implement a course search bar in my project by using web scraping to scrape data from utm course website using Python libraries (Beautiful Soup) & database manipulation (POSTGRE-SQL) 
get and save course data.
